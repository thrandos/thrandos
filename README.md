When ALL the emails are "important", NONE of them are.

I'm learning Java, HTML, and countless other things. I know my way around Azure/AWS, much of the Adobe suite, and way too much of developer-side Minecraft. I use VSCode/Visual Studio, NetBeans, and sometimes just Notepad, but that doesn't count.

In terms of non-programming things, I'm getting pretty good at Davinci Resolve, Avid, and Unity. I've also played around with Linux, mainly Debian and Ubuntu.
